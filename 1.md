# Kowala Tech coding challenge

Welcome to the Kowala tech coding challenge!
At the end of this challenge you will have created a chat application.

## Challenge

The exercise consists in creating a simple protocol that allows the network
users to speak to each other.

* The user should be able to send and view the sent/received messages from the
  console - https://github.com/kowala-tech/kUSD/blob/master/console/console.go.

* The user should be able to select if he wants the protocol enabled in his node
  (cmdline flags). In case the protocol is disabled, he should not be able to
  use the messaging interface to send messages.

* You're free to add any additional feature as long as it makes sense in the
  exercise context.

## Bonus Points - Questions

* Some peers in the network do not have the protocol in question enabled. How do
  you make sure that you are connected to at least one peer with this protocol
  enabled?

* Some peers may go offline and won't be able to receive the messages. How would
  you handle such scenario?

* How would you implement a payed chat service? Could you explain us the
  overall picture of the solution's architecture.

## Extra

* How would you improve our codebase?

## Solution

The final solution should be complete and production ready - your code should be
covered with unit tests. If possible, please include documentation/a development
log covering the most important decisions.

In order to submit the exercise, please fork our repository -
https://github.com/kowala-tech/kUSD/ - and let us know as soon the exercise is
ready.

Good luck,
Kowala Team.
