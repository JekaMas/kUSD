## Kowala

Official implementation of the Kowala protocol based on the [go-ethereum client](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/). The **`kusd`** client is the main client for the Kowala network.
It is the entry point into the Kowala network, and is capable of running a full node. The client offers
a gateway (Endpoints, WebSocket, IPC) to the Kowala network to other processes.

## Quick start

Several quick start options are available:

- [Download the latest release.]()
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/kowala-tech/kUSD.git`

Read the [Getting started page]() for information on the client, networks, and more.
